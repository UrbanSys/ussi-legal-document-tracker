"""
actions.py
Gavin Schultz 2025
Contains functions to call when actions are needed to be done (i.e. clicking a button on an UI). This is 
where I define the actual behaivours for what the UI does. This should be done in a way so that the UI can be 
interchanged as needed, and all that needs to be done is have the UI point to these functions to do everything.
